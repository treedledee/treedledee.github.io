<tr>
<td><i class="material-icons">location_on</i></td>
<td>I'm currently a software engineer working in the bay area and living in
San Francisco. Previously worked as a software analyst for a Fortune 500
Company, an EMT, and a Wilderness First Aid Instructor. Also a closet dork.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><i class="material-icons">school</i></td>
<td>Obtained my Bachelor of Computer Science from Princeton University.
My independent work project involved developing a week-over-week graph
of energy usage around campus. I wanted to make people more aware of
their energy consumption so that they would use less.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><i class="material-icons">computer</i></td>
<td>I enjoy writing software that brings people joy, helps them understand
unmanageable data, and makes life easier. Recently, I've been trying to master Android
and iOS development.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><i class="material-icons">loyalty</i></td>
<td>Addicted to climbing, backpacking, doodling (with secret dreams of designing someday),
traveling at any given (and non-given) moment, meeting new people, and
observing people on public transit.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><i class="material-icons">language</i></td>
<td>Grew up in Durham, North Carolina, with dreams of California in my head.
I spent time in the northeast for undergrad, hopped over to Philadelphia,
PA for a brief time and then
high-tailed it to sunny San Francisco.</td>
