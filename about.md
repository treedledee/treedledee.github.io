## Hi, I'm Theresa!

I am a software engineer living in the San Francisco.

I'm addicted to meeting new people!

The projects page is a nice place to see some of my work, but you can also view my (somewhat outdated) resume.

Grew up in Durham, North Carolina, spent time in Princeton, New Jersey
for undergrad, hopped over to Philadelphia, PA for a brief time and then
high-tailed it to sunny San Francisco. Plus a few random months of wilderness.

## Contact

there will be a form here!
