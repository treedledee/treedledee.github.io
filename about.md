## Hi, I'm Theresa!

Previously worked as a software engineer (Google, IBM, Tagged.com) and web developer in tiny startups (Wish.com, MakeupBee.com, glittr.com, jauntr.com).

Currently a graduate student in Bioinformatics at the University of British Columbia (supervised by Jenny Bryan), with a Bachelor of Computer Science from the University of Waterloo, Canada. My thesis project involves developing computational methods to automatically analyze droplet digital PCR data.

I enjoy writing useful & reusable software tools to help others â€” check out my projects. I have also recently become an avid and active R useR.

I'm addicted to soccer, travelling at any given (and non-given) moment, getting into philosophical debates, and meeting new people!

The projects page is a nice place to see some of my work, but you can also view my (somewhat outdated) resume.

Grew up in Tel Aviv, Israel, moved to Toronto, Canada during my teens, worked in San Francisco after undergrad, crossed the border again to Vancouver, Canada for grad school, spent many months in other countries backpacking.
