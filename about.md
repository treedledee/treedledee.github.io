## Hi, I'm Tree!

I'm a software engineer living in San Francisco.

This is more stuff about me!!

The projects page is a nice place to see some of my work.
I'm addicted to meeting new people!

I grew up in Durham, North Carolina, spent time in Princeton, New Jersey
for undergrad, hopped over to Philadelphia, PA for a brief time and then
high-tailed it to sunny San Francisco. Plus a few random months of wilderness.

I also enjoy doodling.
