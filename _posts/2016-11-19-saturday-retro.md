This weekend is extra busy, so I thought I'd go ahead and
write my retro early. It feels like a lot has happened this week
and I could use the processing.

* Oolong Milk Boba
* iced Mint Mojito from Philz
* Mission burritos

* feeling heard
* getting rid of my car

* the React boilerplate I've inherited has a structure I don't care for
* still a rough commute
* it's cold outside

I wonder what it says about me that the happy things from this week
are all food related? üçìüçíüçèüçäüçâ

The boilerplate structure is getting me down because it uses many
tools that are useful for a large, really complicated single page
application. I'm just building a smaller proof of concept site, so
the extra libraries included are giving me extra troubles. I think
I especially feel it because when beginning with a new framework
it's best to start with the minimum and add new things to it later.
For example, no one would build a house with the house in place, they
build a house after putting down good foundation. Small steps.

I nailed two of my three action items for last week. Let's see what
I can do this week. Action items:

* Decide if I'm going to rip out some of the boilerplate (gasp/cringe)
* Enjoy Thanksgiving! Work stress DNE Life stress
* Begin a small project for myself (maybe a JS game)
