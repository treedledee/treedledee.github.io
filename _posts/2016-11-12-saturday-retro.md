I did a sad thing. I paused blogging. To be fair to myself,
the past few weeks have held a good amount of changes, so I
can't beat myself up too much. Still, reading through my past
Sunday retro helped me to realize how much reflection can aid
in moving forward, learning, and setting a meaningful direction.

So here we go:

* working in React!
* improv class
* sourdough bread

* building a production level app on such a short timeline
* working alone
* groceries

* commute is wearing me down
* less time for climbing
* stress

In the past couple of weeks, I've been assigned to a new project.
I'm working in React and doing front-end development again, which
has been fun. The wireframes and the project itself are
relatively straight-forward and fun to hack away at, I just
wish I had someone to pair program with!

The flip side of that has been working in a new office much
farther from home. By the time Friday rolls around, I start
to really feel the hour of biking per day. Although it's gotten
easier and I've begun to adjust, even the thought of hopping
on my bike right now is making me tired.

While it's 132% worth it, the extra commute time (and additional
activity possibilities that come as a result of living around more
people) does stress me out a bit. It means that I have to take
extra care to prioritize the people I spend time with and the
activities I spend time on.

Action items for the next week include:

* work on blog articles during commute
* groceries groceries groceries
* although I can't pair, ask a co-worker to review code with me
