I'm currently working on a project at Pivotal Labs!
If you've never heard of them, they're an exciting
software consultancy that preaches and practices agile
development and pair programming. Working with them has
been one of the most meaningful experiences of the past
year and a half of my life.

Pivotal has a very specific culture and they take great
pride in pruning it, perfecting it, and figuring out how
to transform the way they transform the way people work.
(Confusing, right? Think about it - they teach people how
to teach other people how to work better and more effectively.
What an awesome mission.)

When my project began, they handed us a glass of the Pivotal kool-aid
and I kind of grabbed a whole pitcher.

Thus, the Sunday Retro is born! Each week, the idea is to reflect.
What did I like? What was meh? What do I want to change? Sometimes
action items come out of the retro, sometimes just awareness. All good things.
