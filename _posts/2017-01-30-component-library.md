React component libraries are awesome. They're changing the way
front-end developers think about displaying content on the page. 
If you haven't heard of them yet, I'd describe them as HTML tags
written by people who've thought about what a front-end developers
need (sometimes) with a little extra thrown in. 

That's why I thought it would be kind of fun to build my own!

But what will be the theme?
