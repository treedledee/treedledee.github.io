I didn't realize how important speaking up in meetings
was until I began working on a project at Pivotal Labs.
Until recently, I spoke on average once per meeting,
because I (a) believed I had nothing to add,
(b) didn't want to add to a conversation that was
already probably going to run over the time allotted for it and
(c) was intimidated by more experienced engineers who
would sometimes discuss details that sounded important and I didn't want
to interrupt.

Big mistake.

After this had gone on for around two weeks, I decided to
poll my co-workers for feedback. I was aware that I wasn't
speaking up, and I wanted to know what the effect was.
Our PM told me an anecdote about an old client who _never_
spoke. The team was convinced that the client hated everyone.
I'm sure this is far from the truth! I was sure that no one
thought this about me (yet) and vowed to change. One older
engineer just thought I had nothing to say, but encouraged
me to jump in more and admitted to sometimes wandering away
from the thread of the essential.

So, I pushed myself to speak up.

Communicating whatever is on your mind is _so important_.

I feel so different now. I feel involved, I'm learning more, and
our team is focusing on what's important. In only a few days
I could feel the impact that speaking up was having on both
my own confidence and my relationship with my team members.
I mattered, I had opinions, and I drove work forward.
I anticipate that in the future, I'll only get better at expressing
what is on my mind and communicating my thoughts with others
in a clear and meaningful way.

Yes, filtering is a key skill to have. Yes, walking around while spewing
opinions at others is probably not the best way to communicate ideas
and earn respect. Doing the work to find the happy area is
worth the time. The risks of not
speaking up are far greater than being polite.

Say the thing!
