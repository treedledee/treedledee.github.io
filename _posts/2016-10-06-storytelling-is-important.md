Over the past few years,
I've learned that one of the most
important skills to have is to be able
to communicate ideas with other people. I say skill, not
ability, because good communication is not something that
humans are born with. There are many different types of
communication and many different forms. Stories are my personal
favorite. They are the most entertaining, memorable, and
essential form of communication.

But crafting a good story is hard. Now that I've sat
down at the keyboard trying to write my own, I realize
how much practice and time I will need to be able to convey the right meaning.

Cue the talk with myself:

_"So... you're giving up already?"_

_"No! I'm not where I thought I would be, but that doesn't mean I have
to give up."_

If I manage to post one idea per day or even just three per week, those
small changes will build up over time. Thirty minutes of interview prep,
thirty minutes of writing and though communication. What is now a
conscious and active effort can someday be reflex. Drops to fill
my metaphorical bucket of skill.

And so the post has morphed into one about how I need
to let go of writing the perfect story.

Post the post.

Do the thing.
