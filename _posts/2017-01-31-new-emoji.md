In my job hunt, I've seen a lot of jobs and a lot of companies.
I've been through countless interview processes. One interesting interview
question that I saw that I've been pondering was: if you could create
a new emoji, what would it be and why.

I saw the question and thought: uhhhh, I dunno! But then the other day when
I was sending a message to a friend to go climb, I went to look for a very
specific emoji and couldn't find it!

The emoji that I would create is a smiley face with a party hat on.
Right now, the only option to convey that oh-so-subtle smile + party
is smile and confetti horn. But what if you just want them both in 
one emoji? The gentle smile says "I'm so glad to see you and I'm so glad
we're doing this," while the party hat says "and it's also going to be awesome."
It's like normal happiness levels with a little extra pizzazz.
Maybe I'll even have the party hat slightly askew to show: "it's going to be
so much fun that your hat will get blown sideways and when people ask about
it you'll say that it was the wind but actually you were having so much fun
that your hat slipped sideways" and your slightly smiling face will confirm it all.

I think it might be time to get a drawing/graphics tablet. :)
