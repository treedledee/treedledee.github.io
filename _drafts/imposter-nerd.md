I was in the car with a friend the other day heading home
when began discussing work and imposter syndrome. We
quickly realized what a nerdy turn our conversation had taken.
She unabashedly exclaimed how much she loved what we were
discussing and I emphatically agreed.

But then she said something else.

"Our conversation isn't even really that nerdy. Sometimes
don't you feel as if you're not even that much of a nerd?"

"Imposter nerd!" I responded.

"Yes!" she said. "There are so many people who fit the
nerd title so much better than I do."

I knew exactly what she meant. I was a nerd, but I also
felt like I didn't partake in some of the typical nerdy
activities.

Imposter syndrome is near and dear to my heart.
We both realized (quite obviously) that imposter syndrome
doesn't only apply to tech.

Our thoughts were ridiculous. A nerd is a nerd is a nerd.
The only person who can tell me that I'm not one is myself.
