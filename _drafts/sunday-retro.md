One of the most meaningful experiences I've had has been
working within the agile environment at Pivotal Labs.
Pivotal has a very specific culture and they take great
pride in pruning it, perfecting it, and figuring out how
to transform the way they transform the way people work.
(Confusing, right? Think about it - they teach people how
to teach other people how to work better and more effectively.
I can't of a cooler mission.)

When my project began, they handed us a glass of Pivotal kool-aid
and I decided to grab a whole pitcher. (I fell in love with agile.)

Thus, the Sunday Retro is born! Each week, the idea is to reflect.
What did I like? What was meh? What do I want to change?
